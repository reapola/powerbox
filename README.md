# Powerbox Tips and tricks

This is the start of my musings, tips and tricks on the Powerbox radio system.  

I hope to include:

-description of powerbox specific systems
-example wiring diagrams
-collection of english manuals

I also plan on creating videos on how to configure the core/atom but that's going to be time dependant.

Anything here is my thoughts and I am not affiliated with PowerBox-Systems GmbH or PowerBox-Systems Americas Corp.
